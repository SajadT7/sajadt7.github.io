CV FILE INSTRUCTIONS
====================

You need to upload your CV as "CV.pdf" to your GitHub repository.

The navigation menu on all pages now includes a "CV" link that will open your CV PDF file.

STEPS:
1. Save your CV as "CV.pdf" (exact filename, capital letters)
2. Upload CV.pdf to your GitHub repository (same folder as index.html)
3. The CV link in the navigation will automatically work

The CV you uploaded earlier in our conversation can be used - just make sure it's named "CV.pdf" when you upload it to GitHub.

If you want to use a different filename, update these lines in all HTML files:
- Change <a href="CV.pdf">CV</a> to your filename
